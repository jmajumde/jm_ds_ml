The String Game
Description
Sanskar and Mahima are playing the String Game.

Rules of the game are as follows.

Both players are given the same string, S.
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string S.
Sanskar has to make words starting with consonants.
Mahima has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring of the game is done by the following rule

A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string S.

For Example:

S = BANANA

Mahima's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Mahima will get 2 Points.  ï»¿

Sanskar wins

Your task is to determine the winner and their score.

Sample Input      : BANANA
Sample Output : Sanskar 12

Please note that this question was asked in a Data Analyst interview.

Identity Cards
Description
You have been asked to ensure that the first and last names of employees in an organization begin with a capital letter in their identity cards. For example, akshay ginodia should be capitalised correctly as Akshay Ginodia.

akshay ginodia  => Akshay Ginodia

Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

Input Format

A single line of input containing the full name, S.

Constraints

0 < len(S) < 100

The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc, when capitalized, remains 12abc.

Output Format
Print the capitalized string, S.
Sample Input: akshay ginodia
Sample Output: Akshay Ginodia

Binary Representation
Description
Given a positive integer 'n', print the binary representation of the number.

Constraint
n < 10000

Input format: A single integer denoting 'n'
Output format: A string denoting the binary representation of the number 'n'

Sample Input  : 19
Sample Output : 10011

Use the fewest character possible characters to display the output. For instance, if '1' is input, the output should be '1'. Do not provide '0001' or '01' as the output.
